# Hackaton - Wine

## About
We had 26 hours to develop a landing page for [Wine](https://www.wine.com.br/) company, following two requirements: it should be different from their current landing page, and consume one of two APIs made available by Wine. 
21 groups participated in the challenge, and our project took third place. Click [here](https://isabelanery.github.io/hackaton-wine/) to check it out!

This was Wine's landing page at the time:

We decided to create a simple and intuitive design, so the user can spend less time searching for, and more time enjoying a good wine. 

Our idea was to begin by explaing how the Wine Club works and the advantages it offers, in a crystal clear way.

We also decided to simplify the contents, creating a page that leads you into different ways, by implementing routes that take the client to a new page where they can fully enjoy the site's features one sip at the time.

Pedro, Catherine and I developed the React structure of the page in pair programming, and I was responsible for implementing the design with CSS. Nikolas and Juliana created the banner designs used in the carousel and the presentation of the project.
